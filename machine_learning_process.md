# The main steps for machine learning project
1. Understand and identify the business problem 
2. Understand and identify the data
3. Collect and prepare the data --> 80% of the project
   1. Data collection
   2. Cleansing
   3. Aggregation
   4. Labeling
   5. Transformation
4. Determine the model's features and train the model.
   1. Model technique selection
   2. Training
   3. Hyperparameter setting
   4. Validation
   5. Development and testing
   6. Algorithm selection
   7. model optimization
5. Evalute the model performance
   1. Model metric evaluation
   2. Confusion matrix calculations
   3. KPIs
   4. Model performance metrics
   5. Model quality measurements
   6. Final determination of whether the model can meet the established business goals.
6. experiment and adjust the model in operation
   1. see how the model works in real life world
7. repeat the process and apply improvements.

> Approach the problem with the mindset that the more care and time invested at the beginning, the better the outcome will be.
